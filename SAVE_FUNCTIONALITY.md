# Database Save Functionality Implementation

## Overview
All save operations in the Sparti Builder and CMS now properly save to the Supabase database with proper tenant isolation.

## Updated Components

### 1. ContentEditPanel.tsx
- **Save Button**: Always visible for all components (not just specific types)
- **Database Integration**: Uses `useSupabaseDatabase` hook
- **Tenant Support**: Automatically saves under the current tenant
- **User Feedback**: Shows toast notifications for success/error states
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. PagesManager.tsx
- **Real Database**: Replaced localStorage with Supabase database
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete pages
- **Publishing**: Toggle published status with database persistence
- **Slug Generation**: Automatic URL slug generation from page titles
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations

### 3. ComponentLibrary.tsx
- **Dynamic Loading**: Loads components from Supabase database
- **Search & Filter**: Search and category filtering of saved components
- **Component Management**: Activate/deactivate and delete components
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately after database operations

### 4. CMSSettingsContext.tsx
- **Database Integration**: Settings automatically sync to Supabase
- **Tenant Isolation**: Settings are tenant-specific
- **Auto-save**: Settings are debounced and auto-saved to prevent excessive API calls

## Database Schema Integration

### Tables Used:
- `components` - Stores reusable components from the editor
- `pages` - Stores page content and metadata
- `site_settings` - Stores site-wide settings and branding
- `sections` - Stores page sections (for future use)

### Row Level Security (RLS):
- All tables have tenant-based RLS policies
- Data is automatically isolated by tenant
- Users can only access their own tenant's data

## How to Use

### Saving Components:
1. Click "Edit with Sparti" on any page
2. Select any element to edit
3. Click the "Save to Database" button in the edit panel
4. Component is saved with current tenant context

### Managing Pages:
1. Go to `/admin` and login
2. Navigate to Pages section
3. Create new pages or manage existing ones
4. All changes are immediately saved to database

### Managing Components:
1. Go to `/admin/components`
2. View all saved components from the editor
3. Activate/deactivate or delete components
4. Search and filter components by type

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow:
1. Users authenticate via Supabase Auth
2. Tenant context is automatically set
3. All database operations respect tenant isolation

### Error Handling:
- Network errors are caught and displayed to users
- Validation errors show specific field issues
- Success operations show confirmation messages

### Performance:
- Database queries are optimized for tenant isolation
- Loading states prevent multiple concurrent operations
- Debounced auto-save prevents excessive API calls

## Next Steps

The save functionality is now fully integrated with Supabase. Users can:
- Edit elements on their site and save them as reusable components
- Manage pages through the CMS dashboard
- Customize site settings with automatic database persistence
- All data is properly isolated by tenant for multi-tenant usage

All save operations now provide real-time feedback and persist data to the Supabase database with proper tenant isolation and security.
