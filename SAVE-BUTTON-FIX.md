## Quick Fix Applied âœ…

**Problem**: Save button was conditionally hidden when `config.contentAPI` wasn't properly set.

**Solution**: Made the Save button always visible in edit mode and added debug logging.

### Now You Should See:
1. **Save button** appears when you click "Edit with Sparti Builder" 
2. **Console logs** showing the toolbar configuration
3. **Save functionality** working (even if content server isn't running yet)

### Next Steps:

#### 1. Test the Save Button (Now Visible)
- Click "Edit with Sparti Builder" 
- You should now see: [Undo] [Save] [X] buttons
- Try clicking Save to test

#### 2. Start Content Server (If You Want Persistence)
```bash
# Make executable (first time only)
chmod +x start-content-server.sh

# Start server
./start-content-server.sh
```

#### 3. Check Browser Console
- Look for "SpartiToolbar render" logs 
- This will show the configuration state

### Troubleshooting:
- **Still no toolbar?** Check if SpartiBuilder wrapper is correctly applied
- **Save button grayed out?** Check if `handleSave` function is working
- **Save fails?** Start the content server first

The Save button should now be visible immediately when you enter edit mode!
